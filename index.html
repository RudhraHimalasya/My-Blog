                    I had visited meenakshi mall with my family.it was an awesome place , I had an amazing time! I first went to visit my dentist then I went to see the movie Frozen 2 in the Mall. The movie was in 3D . We ate popcorn,samosa,French Fries,egg puff and veg puff. The mall is very big, it is in bangalore, it had games which me and my sister played, we played different games like the whale game, basket ball, ice-boat ride with polar bears and penguins (the penguins and the polar bears are fake). After that we got ice cream. Then we went to the fourth floor and got a foot massage from tiny black living fishes, the fishes tickled us. we took a lot of pictures and I even met my school friend Ashi.

                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by P3anic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

                            Piper Maclane wants a pet so badly, but she’s allergic to everything. So she creates her own . . . out of slime! From Epic! Originals, My Pet Slime is a sweet, slimy series about a girl who makes the most of a challenging situation and is rewarded with a bit of magic!
                            <br><br>
                            Piper wishes she could have a pet to care for and snuggle with and take to school for show-and-tell. All of the other kids have one. But she’s allergic to every animal imaginable! So instead, she makes her own pet out of slime, with big eyes, a little mouth, and two arms just long enough for hugs. It would be the perfect pet for Piper, if it were real. When a strange turn of events brings her slime to life, Piper learns how fun, challenging, and messy it can be to care for a pet . . . especially one made out of slime!
